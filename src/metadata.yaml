description: |
  GlusterFS is an open source, distributed file system capable of scaling
  to several petabytes (actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands
  of clients. GlusterFS clusters together storage building blocks over
  Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect, aggregating disk and memory
  resources and managing data in a single global namespace. GlusterFS
  is based on a stackable user space design and can deliver exceptional
  performance for diverse workloads.
